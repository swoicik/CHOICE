# 2.9 - A Fight For Control

The more you try to control everything done on a district issued device the more disastrous the 1-1 program will be.

Focus on educating staff and students on how to use the devices. A focus on what is possible with the technology and not what you're not allowed to do. 

Preach "How to be good Digital Citizens."

Teach user how to use the technology ethically and responsibly. Not lock down everything so they need to ask to do anything or are afraid to explore the device. The devices should be personal to the users, not have the feeling of a surveillance tool. Learning happens during exploration and experimentation. Technology follows the same rules. 

Donâ€™t try to lock down everything, allow what you can, and let mistakes be teaching moments. Students need to learn from mistakes. Even mistakes with technology. Letting those mistakes happen in a school environment where they can be fixed and learned from, is far better then it happening in the outside world.

Give students more control over what they do with the devices. Make them more personal. Students should be able to perform the tasks they perform in the real world. Not just things allowed or installed by administrators. Let students install Apps.
